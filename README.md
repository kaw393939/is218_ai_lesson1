PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/test_calculator.py -v  # Should pass ✅
```

### Step 2: Start Lesson 1

## 🎮 How This Works

Each lesson follows the same pattern:

1. **📖 Read** the lesson (learn the concepts)
2. **❌ Run tests** (see them fail)
3. **💻 Write code** (make tests pass)
4. **✅ Tests pass** (you did it!)
5. **🎯 Commit** (save your work)

**Example:**
```bash
# See tests fail
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/part1_configuration/test_lesson_1_1.py -v
# ❌ 12 failed

# Write your code...

# See tests pass!
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/part1_configuration/test_lesson_1_1.py -v
# ✅ 12 passed

# Commit
git commit -m "feature: lesson 1.1 complete"
```
